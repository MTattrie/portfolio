            <h3> Projects </h3>
            <p> Majority of the projects presented were done during my second year of enrollment at BCIT's Computer Systems Technology
                course in the Data Communications option. Learn more about the projects we've done and this specific option
                <a href='http://milliways.bcit.ca/'>here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Please note that I will be adding more to the projects section at a later date</i>
            </P>
            <h4>MAR-Z</h4>
            <p>This was my favorite project throughout BCIT even if it was rough at times. MAR-Z is a topdown shooter, multiplayer
                game that our Datacommunications class built from scratch in our final semester without a teacher overseeing
                everything. There were 2 project managers and 6 teamleads that oversaw this giant project. I was a teamlead
                for the Audio/Gamelogic Core2 team that consisted of 4 people. We created the games sounds, sfx, music as
                well as developming core gamelogic functionality like weapon firing, hitdetection/collision and more. This
                was a great leadership opportunity for me and it taught me a lot about handling a team, individuals and keeping
                constant open communication. The start of the project was kind of a disaster as organization among all groups
                was not the best and everyone kinda just trusted everyone else to complete the self given deadlines. Note
                that BCIT is known for its crazy workload and we had roughly 4 other projects at any given time. Chaos quickly
                ensued as deadlines were not being met. One individual I had in particular did not only fail to complete
                the provided deadlines but also lied about it. After about a week of giving this person the benefit of the
                doubt, I realized that I had to be more strict and organized keeping constant open communication with him.
                After helping him get caught up to where we should be, I ended up setting more team-meetings overall inorder
                to check that work was being done properly and that we would be able to adjust our priorities if necessary.
                Overall it was a great learning experience and an awesome finished project. Check it out

            <h4>Neartuit</h4>
            <p> This was a BCIT COMP 4900 project where I worked in a team of 4 to develop a Content Management System (CMS)
                to allow Neartuit's customers to create web-pages from provided templates. Generally their customers are
                not the most tech-savy and as a result we designed a simple, user-friendly system tested on multiple browsers,
                operating systems, and a variety of devices with a mobile first design using bootstrap. This project was
                interesting because it was the first time working with a noSQL database (google firebase). Starting out working
                on the CMS we would be developing functions that would alter the firebase. As we were testing these functions
                you would hear another teammate yell out in frustration because we would accidently wipe a section that they
                needed.
            </p>
            <h4>Wireless-Protocol-Implementation</h4>
            <p>This was one of our hardest projects in Datacommunications. We as a class designed a Wireless-Protocol to work
                on windows that would transfer files of text from one computer to another on LAN. After designing the Wireless-Protocol
                we split up into groups of 4. I was with my good ol' Set D buds Jordan, Brody and Jacob where we spent countless
                nights after school to get this thing working. The main idea of our protocol was a super simple version of
                a tcp connection consisting of a SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK 3 way handshake. For some reason we assumed our protocol
                specs were correct with baseless reasoning which caused a major roadblock for all groups. Eventually we decided
                to screw the specs and go for a proof of concept that we could actually transfer a textfile from one computer
                to another. After completing the project our teacher Aman told us that the classes specs were impossible
                to have a working connection. This really stressed to work with what you know first and then go to the next
                step and so forth. Check out the project on Brody's github

            <h4>SignPosts</h4>
            <p>This was our final project for our Android App Development class. At the time Pokemon Go was blowing up everywhere.
                As a result we thought why not do something similar and learn how to use GPS for android apps. The main concept
                is that you can leave a message for other users at your current location. When you are close enough to message
                it will appear on your device and you can open it up. Basically it is the Pokestop system but with notes
                instead. Unfortunately the app is not available at this current time.
            </p>
            <h4>CommAudio</h4>
            <p> This was our third and final assignment in COMP4985. The object of this project was to create a multicast streaming
                audioplayer using TCP and UDP connections and sockets. One computer is the server that actually contains
                the music to play and sends packets to the connected clients. This application also has a microphone mode
                to broadcast input to the connected computers. I was the teamlead in this project as well and kept our group
                of 4 on track. We started out this project by meeting several times to start designing how this massive project
                would flow/work (types of requests, i.e play,pause, addsong...), how many states the server/client could
                be in, what the packets structure we are sending would look like, and much more. Design work was a major
                focus for all our Datacomm projects and without it we would be lost trying to just guess and test without
                actually thinking it through first. In order for this to work we needed multiple threads for reading and
                sending data to the sockets as the server needed to listen for commands and then send the appropriate packets
                back to the clients. The server also needed to listen for new connections from clients as well. The actual
                song data would be sent to a circular buffer inorder to prevent stuttering in the song between applications
                and overflow. The playlist is just a que that gets popped when finished. Check out the git
